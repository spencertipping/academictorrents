# Docker image
Everything runs from the same docker image, which I publish as
[`spencertipping/academictorrents` on
Dockerhub](https://hub.docker.com/r/spencertipping/academictorrents). If you
want to build the image from source:

```sh
$ ./build                     # builds a local spencertipping/academictorrents
```
