# Academic Torrents processes
I maintain some public datasets for local use and mirror them to [Academic
Torrents](https://academictorrents.com). This repository contains all of the
source code for those processes. Everything is run through Docker, so you should
be able to reproduce everything here.

**TODO:** start dockerizing existing processes
